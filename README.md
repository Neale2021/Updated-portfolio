# Updated-portfolio

So as homework we were set the task to update our portfolio from week 2 the following things were set:

Your updated portfolio should:
Display your contact information. If you don't want to share your personal email or phone number, use a separate email that you will only use for coding, also known as a developer email, and/or a call forwarding service, such as Google Voice.
Have links to your GitHub profile and LinkedIn profile
Have a link to a downloadable PDF of your resume (I have not done this because i have not done a resume for 20+ years and plan not to do one, if i get marked down then so be it)
Display at least 2 examples of student work from either deployed projects or homeworks. For each project, make sure you have the following:
Project title
Link to the deployed version
Link to the GitHub repository
Screenshot of the deployed application
Have a polished, mobile-responsive user interface.

This is a showcase of what has changed
